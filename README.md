# Target


Target(Astronomy) is a small WiFi-Handbox to control a telecope mount via INDI. This box is running with battery and does not have any wire to the telecope mount. This box consists out of a electronic board, a ESP8266 firmware (arduino IDE) and a Qt5 application bridging the handbox to the INDI mount. The handbox provides four keys for N,S,W and E, one slew speed key with three LED's and a function key which change the N,S,W and E key to Focuser 1 in and out and Focuser 2 in and out (not tested yet, I don't have any motor focuser).
